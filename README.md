Really just a collection of systems and extensions for the Lyra starter sample that I use while prototyping new games.
It's not a proper repo but contains a few interesting things here and there like:

- A possessable vehicle
- Camera modes for first and third person vehicle driving
- A subsystem to manage a herd of actors that will be acting with a single brain, in a chosen formation
